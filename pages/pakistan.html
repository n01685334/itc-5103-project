          <p>Pakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 metres and 4555 above 6,000 m. There is no count of the peaks
            above
            5,000 and 4,000 m. Five of the 14 highest independent peaks in the world (the eight-thousanders) are in
            Pakistan (four of which lie in the surroundings of Concordia; the confluence of Baltoro Glacier and Godwin
            Austen Glacier).
          </p>
          <p>Most of the highest peaks in Pakistan lie in the Karakoram mountain range (which lies almost entirely in
            the
            Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, and is considered to be a separate range from Himalayan range) but some
            peaks above 7,000 m are included in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. Moreover, Pakistan is home to over
            7,000 glaciers, more than anywhere except the polar regions</p>

            <h3>K2 Mountain</h3>
            <p>K2, at 8,611 metres (28,251 ft) above sea level, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount
              Everest at 8,849 metres (29,032 ft). It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the
              Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in the China-administered
              Trans-Karakoram Tract in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.
              K2 also became popularly known as the Savage Mountain after George Bell—a climber on the 1953
              American expedition—told reporters, "It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you." Of the five
              highest mountains in the world, K2 is the deadliest; approximately one person dies on the mountain
              for every four who reach the summit.Also occasionally known as Mount Godwin-Austen,other nicknames
              for K2 are The King of Mountains and The Mountaineers' Mountain, as well as The Mountain of
              Mountains after prominent Italian climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same.</p>

            <h3>Nangaparbat Mountain</h3>
            <p>Nanga Parbat (Urdu: نانگا پربت) (Urdu: [nəŋa pərbət̪]; lit.'naked mountain'), known locally as
              Diamer (Shina: دیآمر, lit.'King of the Mountains'), is the ninth-highest mountain on Earth and its
              summit is at 8,126 m (26,660 ft) above sea level.Lying immediately southeast of the northernmost
              bend of the Indus River in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Nanga
              Parbat is the westernmost major peak of the Himalayas, and thus in the traditional view of the
              Himalayas as bounded by the Indus and Yarlung Tsangpo/Brahmaputra rivers, it is the western anchor
              of the entire mountain range.

              Nanga Parbat is one of the 14 eight-thousanders. An immense, dramatic peak rising far above its
              surrounding terrain, it has the second highest prominence among the 100 tallest mountains on Earth
              only behind Mount Everest. Nanga Parbat is notorious for being an extremely difficult climb, and has
              earned the nickname Killer Mountain for its high number of climber fatalities and pushing climbers
              to the test of their limits.</p>

            <h3>Rakaposhi Mountain</h3>
            <p>Rakaposhi (Burushaski: رآکاپوݜی, lit.'Shining Wall'; Urdu: راکاپوشی) also known as Dumani
              (Burushaski: دومآنی, lit.'Mother of Mist') is a mountain within the Karakoram range. It is situated
              in the middle of the Nagar Valley and the Bagrote Valley, which is part of the Gilgit-Baltistan
              territory in Pakistan. The mountain is extremely broad, measuring almost 20km from east to west. It
              is the only peak on earth that descends directly and without interruption for almost 6,000 meters
              from its summit to its base</p>
