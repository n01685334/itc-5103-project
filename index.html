          There are 268 mountain peaks over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level on the island, with Yushan (Jade
          Mountain – in Chinese) being the tallest mountain in both Taiwan and East Asia. Mountaineering is one of the
          most popular activities for many Taiwanese. A list of 100 Peaks of Taiwan was created in 1971, which lists the
          selected one hundred mountain peaks over 3,000 m for mountaineering on the island. Climbing all of the one
          hundred mountain peaks listed is considered a great challenge for Taiwanese climbers.
        </p>
        <p>Geologically, Taiwan comprises a tilted fault block, characterized by the contrast between the eastern
          two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges running parallel to the east coast, and the flat
          to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of the population resides. Several peaks
          exceed 3,500 m in height - the highest, Yu Shan at 3,952 m (12,966 ft), makes Taiwan the world's
          fourth-highest island. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges remains active, and the island
          experiences many earthquakes, some of them highly destructive. There are also many active submarine volcanoes
          in the Taiwan Straits.</p>
        <p>
          The climate ranges from tropical in the south to subtropical in the north, and is governed by the East Asian
          Monsoon. On average, four typhoons strike the main island each year. The heavily forested eastern mountains
          provide a habitat for a diverse range of wildlife, while human land use in the western and northern lowlands
          is intensive.

          <p class="title">Alishan Mountain Range</p>
          <p>The Alishan Range (Chinese: 阿里山山脈; pinyin: Ālǐ Shān Shānmài) is a mountain range in the central-southern
            region of Taiwan. It is separated by the Qishan River from the Yushan Range, the tallest range in Taiwan, to
            the east of the Alishan Range. The highest peak of the Alishan Range is Datashan (大塔山), which has a height
            of 2,663 m (8,737 ft).</p>

            Shān) is a mountain in Beitou District, Taipei, Taiwan. It is located within the Tatun Volcanic Group and is
            the highest mountain in the city, at the rim of Taipei Basin. It is also the highest (dormant) volcano in
            Taiwan.</p>
          <p>
            It is located in the center of Yangmingshan National Park; its main peak is 1,120 meters (3,670 ft)
            above sea level.

          <p class="title">Yu Shan (Jade Mountain)</p>
          <p>Yu Shan or Yushan, also known as Mount Jade, Jade Mountain, or Mount Niitaka during Japanese rule, is the
            highest mountain in Taiwan at 3,952 m (12,966 ft)[citation needed]above sea level, giving Taiwan the
            4th-highest maximum elevation of any island in the world. It is the highest point in the western Pacific
            region outside of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Yushan and its surrounding mountains belong to the Yushan Range.
          </p>
          <p>The area was once in the ocean; it rose to its current height because of the Eurasian Plate's movement over
            the Philippine Sea Plate. Yushan is ranked 40th by topographic isolation.</p>
